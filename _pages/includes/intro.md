# âœ¨ About me
Bonjour, I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Sciences at [the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/), advised by [Prof. Sharon Yixuan Li](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~sharonli/). Before this, I obtain the graduate degree of computer application technology at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Jie Chen](https://scholar.google.fi/citations?user=ZAZFfwwAAAAJ&hl=en). I received a B.S. degree from the College of Computer Science (Elite Class), in [Jilin University](https://www.jlu.edu.cn/), in 2022.

My research interests lie broadly in Trustworthy AI, with a particular focus on:
- (a) Foundation Model (e.g. LLM/LMM) Alignment
- (b) Foundation Model (e.g. LLM/LMM) Attack/Defence.
- (c) Semi-supervised Learning (e.g. classification and segmentation)
- (d) Responsible AIGC (e.g. talking head generation, t2i/t2v generation model)

ðŸ˜ƒ **I am seeking research collaboration opportunities. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in potential collaboration!**
