# âœ¨ About me
Bonjour, I am currently a master student at the School of Electronic and Computer Engineering, [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Jie Chen](https://scholar.google.fi/citations?user=ZAZFfwwAAAAJ&hl=en). Before this, I received a B.S. degree from the College of Computer Science (Elite Class), in [Jilin University](https://www.jlu.edu.cn/), in 2022.

My research interests are Trustworthy AI, especially:
- (a) Foundation Model (e.g. LLM/LMM) Safety
- (b) Semi-supervised Learning (e.g. classification and segmentation)
- (c) Responsible AIGC (e.g. talking head generation, t2i/t2v generation model)

ðŸ˜ƒ **I am looking for USA PhD to start in 2025 Fall. Feel free to contact me if you have any opening!**
